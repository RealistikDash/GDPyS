# GDPyS
The modern implementation of the Geometry Dash server protocol meant to take Geometry Dash servers to the moon ðŸš€!

## Objectives of the project!
GDPyS aims to revolutionise the Geometry Dash server space. Here are some of its main goals for the final product:
- Stable maintainable code base
- Embracing modernity, not fearing to use the latest modules and syntax
- Speed and security
- Simplicity of modification and expansion
- Efficient database usage
- Fully asynchronous codebase

## Requirements
To run GDPyS, the requirements differ significantly when compared to other solutions.
- Linux server (tested on Ubuntu 18.04)
- Nginx (or any other web server supporting UNIX sockets)
- Python >=3.8
- Web domain

## On development
GDPyS v3 is still really unfinished... The project has underwent several rewrites due to my dissatisfaction with the code base, attempting to solve major architectural flaws with the project. While this is really good learning-wise (GDPyS has been the greatest source of learning for me by far), it is not good for delivering a finished product. Please note that **GDPyS is hobby project**, meaning I am not paid to do anything, I do it fully for fun. This means that I may take occasional breaks from the project every now and then due to burnout.

If you wish to see the project progress faster, feel free to contribute through pull requests! All contribution attempts are welcomed warmly.
